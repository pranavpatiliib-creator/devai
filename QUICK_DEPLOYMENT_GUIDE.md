| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Images not showing | Clear cache, check `/images/` folder |
| Styles broken | Verify `/css/` folder, check ../css/ paths |
| Menu not working | Check `/js/hamburger.js` is loaded |
| Wrong page paths | All use relative paths (../) - should work everywhere |
